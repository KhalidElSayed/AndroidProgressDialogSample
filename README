Sample code showing some Activities that display a progress dialog to the user, 
and have different ways of reacting during screen orientation changes.

Accompanying article can be found here : http://blog.doityourselfandroid.com/2010/11/14/handling-progress-dialogs-and-screen-orientation-changes/

The app allows you to launch the following activities.

* "AllOnUIThread"
A sample where a progress dialog is created and dismissed on the UI thread.
Added to illustrate that the progress dialog will never be shown.

* "AsyncTaskSimple"
Implementation using an AsyncTask, where the progress dialog will be shown, but causes problems
during screen orientation.

"AsyncTaskSimpleStateSaving"
Implementation based on the previous AsyncTask, but now with a simple state saving mechanism, 
again causing problems during screen orientation.

"AsyncTaskSimpleConfigured"
Implementation based on android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation", where the activity is not 
re-created after a screen orientation change in order to handle screen orientations gracefully. 
 
"AsyncTaskComplex"
A more complex implementation that handles screen orientations gracefully without resorting to the 
android:configChanges "fix".
